#How to Build
The only thing you need is an API key from the Connectivity Map group. If you don't have one, you can request one by emailing clue@broadinstitute.org

Once you have it, add a plist file to your project called "API.plist" and create an attribute called "BaristaUserKey". Set that bad boy to your API key and build away!
